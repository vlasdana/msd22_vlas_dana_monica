# Calculator Game

### _A good way to train **math** and calculation **speed**_

## Short Description

After starting the application, a game should be started which presents you with 7 random math problems. The math problems should consist of two random integers between -100 and 500 and a random operator from the list of basic arithmetic operations (\*, +, -, /). The math problems should be answered directly via the console.

## Installation Guide

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine
2.  Open the project in your preferred IDE
3.  Compile and run the project

## Usage Guide

1. Run the Application class (Application.java)
2. The game will start and present you with 7 random math problems
3. Answer the math problems directly via the console
4. The program will perform checks on the input to ensure it is valid and correct
5. After answering all 7 math problems, the program will summarize the inputs and output the following information:

- Number of the math problem
- Math problem including the entered solution
- Information whether the math problem was solved correctly
- Time required for the math problem in sec (rounded to 2 decimal places)
- Average time of all math problems
- Additional text if all math problems were answered correctly
